INSTRUCTIONS:
linearapproxtable.c generates linear approximation table corresponding to the s box
proprato.c generates differential approximation table 
The inputs for files are  S_boxnumbers2.txt and actinp.txt which are hardcoded in corresponding .c files. 

INSTRUCTION to run:
run make
run ./linapp   -gives linear approximation table  
./Lineartrial to give Linear trial
./diffapp   -gives differential approx table
./Difftrial -gives Differential table
./encryption <input_filename> <encrypt_filename>    -Does encryption
./decryption <encrypt_filename> <decrypt_filename>  -Does decryption
run  make clean to remove executable and object files
